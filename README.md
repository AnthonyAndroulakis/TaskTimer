# Task Timer
keep track of tasks

2 types of tasks:
- Fixed Time (FT)
	- will take a fixed amount of time no matter what
	- these are for tasks where only completing the task within the reasonable time frame is incentivized
- Variable Time (VT)
	- might take a max time of x minutes but can be done quicker
